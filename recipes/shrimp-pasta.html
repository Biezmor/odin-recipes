            <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon crushed garlic</li>
            <li>¼ cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 medium lemon, zested and juiced</li>
            <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>5 large basil leaves, chopped</li>
            <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season shrimp with salt and pepper; add to the pan and cook 30 seconds per side. Remove to a plate.
            <li>Add shallots to the skillet and cook for 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in chicken broth, lemon zest, and 1/2 of the lemon juice; heat for 2 minutes. Reserve remaining lemon juice for another use.</li>
            <li>Add cream and bring to a simmer. Return shrimp to the skillet and cook until heated through and pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Add basil.</li>
            <li>Drain spaghetti, reserving 1/4 to 1/2 cup pasta water.</li>
            <li>Add spaghetti to the skillet. Add pasta water as needed and pepper flakes; toss to coat. Season with pepper if desired.</li>
        </ol>
