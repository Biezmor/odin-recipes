        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This <strong>mint chocolate chip ice cream</strong> is made in an ice cream maker with milk, cream, sugar, peppermint extract, and lots of chocolate chips. I discovered using 2% milk in the recipe makes the ice cream taste lighter.</p>
        <p><em>Super refreshing on a hot summer day!</em></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups 2% milk</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 drops green food coloring (optional)</li>
            <li>1 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir milk, cream, sugar, vanilla, peppermint extract, and salt together in a large bowl until the sugar has dissolved. Mix in green food coloring.</li>
            <li>Pour mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
            <li>Add chocolate chips about 10 minutes into the freezing. Continue churning until ice cream has thickened, about 20 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, about 2 hours.</li>
        </ol>
