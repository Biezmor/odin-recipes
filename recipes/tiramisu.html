    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy <strong>tiramisu</strong> recipe makes a classic Italian dessert with ladyfingers dipped in coffee liqueur and a sweet mascarpone mixture. I think the layers look beautiful when you make the tiramisu in a glass bowl and dust the top with cocoa powder and chocolate curls.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>2 (12 ounce) packages ladyfingers</li>
        <li>⅓ cup coffee flavored liqueur</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) square semisweet chocolate</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine egg yolks and sugar in the top of a double boiler, over boiling water. Reduce heat to low, and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and whip yolks until thick and lemon-colored.</li>
        <li>Add mascarpone to whipped yolks. Beat until combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whip cream to stiff peaks. Gently fold into yolk mixture and set aside.</li>
        <li>Split the lady fingers in half, and line the bottom and sides of a large glass bowl. Brush with coffee liqueur.</li>
        <li>Spoon half of the cream filling over the lady fingers.</li>
        <li>Repeat ladyfingers, coffee liqueur and filling layers.</li>
        <li>Garnish with cocoa and chocolate curls. Refrigerate several hours or overnight. <em>Enjoy!</em></li>

    </ol>
